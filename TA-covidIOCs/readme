This TA is designed for Linux systems (and most likely OSX) to download IPs, Newly created Domains, and hashes, and URLs related to COVID attacks. The data comes from a crowdsourced Github repo (https://github.com/parthdmaniar/coronavirus-covid-19-SARS-CoV-2-IoCs) and includes data from a variety of sources including openly provided data from Virustotal, Domaintools, and Anomomali. Sometimes the data has some #s and/or is broken, so use at your risk. You probably should use this in dev environments to verify the info.  Special thanks to LilyLily Lee @splunk for cleaning up all of my bad TA hygiene.
