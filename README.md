# TA-covidiocs
This TA is designed for Linux systems (and most likely OSX) to download IPs, newly created Domains, and hashes, and URLs related to COVID attacks. This was inspired by data provided on the Repo: https://github.com/parthdmaniar/coronavirus-covid-19-SARS-CoV-2-IoCs) but now includes data from http://cti-league.com/. Sometimes the data has some #s, are FalsePositives, and/or is broken. So use at your risk. You probably should use this in dev environments to verify the info.  Special thanks to LilyLily Lee @splunk for cleaning up all of my bad TA hygiene.
